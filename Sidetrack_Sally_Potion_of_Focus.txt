Sidetrack Sally and the Potion of Focus  
A Lighthearted Fantasy Adventure  

---  

Chapter 1: The Mission (Or So It Seemed…)  

Sidetrack Sally dashed down the cobblestone streets of Everwhim, her mismatched enchanted robes billowing behind her. Her ornate staff clinked against her belt as she muttered to herself.  

“Right! Task for today—pick up a vial of Moonblossom Nectar. Easy peasy!”  

She reached into her satchel and pulled out a small parchment. It was a neatly written note from her mentor, Master Orwyn, who had long given up trusting Sally to remember important tasks.  

SALLY, GO TO MAGDA’S POTIONS. BUY MOONBLOSSOM NECTAR. COME STRAIGHT BACK. NO DETOURS. NO DISTRACTIONS. SERIOUSLY.  

Sally snorted. “Pfft. As if I’d get distracted. I’m a professional wizard!”  

A glimmer of movement caught her eye.  

“Oooooh! Floating candles!”  

Within seconds, she had veered off course, chasing a trio of enchanted candles bobbing through the air. They danced toward an open bakery window, filling the air with the scent of cinnamon buns.  

Sally inhaled deeply.  

“Wait, what was I doing again?”

Chapter 2: A Slight Detour (Okay, Maybe a Huge One)  

Ten minutes later, Sally exited the bakery with three buns, a tiny floating fire sprite that had somehow hitched a ride in her pocket, and absolutely no Moonblossom Nectar.  

“Alright, no more distractions,” she declared, biting into a warm bun. “Focus, Sally! Focus—ooooooh! A STREET MAGICIAN!”  

A magician was juggling glowing orbs while a crowd cheered. Sally elbowed her way to the front, eyes wide with excitement.  

“Wait, I can do that!” she said, grabbing her staff and flicking it dramatically. A flurry of golden sparks burst into the air. “Ta-da!”  

The magician gasped. The crowd gasped. Sally gasped.  

Mostly because she had accidentally turned the magician’s hat into a bowl of pudding.  

“…Oops.”

Chapter 3: The Consequences (And Also, More Distractions)  

By the time Sally actually made it to Magda’s Potion Shop, the sun was already setting. The old potion maker squinted at her over tiny spectacles.  

“Let me guess,” Magda said dryly. “You got distracted.”  

Sally scoffed. “What? Me? Pfft. No way. I just… took the scenic route?”  

Magda sighed and handed over the vial of Moonblossom Nectar.  

Sally grinned. “Thank you! Master Orwyn will be so happy I—”  

She paused.  

“…Wait, why did I need this again?”  

Magda groaned.  

Sally clutched the vial. “Oh! Right! Focus potion! No time to waste! Must hurry home!”  

She turned on her heel—then stopped.  

A tiny enchanted frog was croaking in the corner of the shop, glowing faintly.  

“Ooooh,” Sally whispered. “Shiny.”  

And just like that, she was off again.

The End (For Now…)
